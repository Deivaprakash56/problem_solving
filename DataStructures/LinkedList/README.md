## Introduction to Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains a data part and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory locations, which makes them more flexible in terms of memory management.

## Types of linked lists

1. Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node
2. Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both the next and  previous nodes.
3. Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node.
